# vim-scopes
Vim syntax plugin for the Scopes language

How to rebuild the plugin:
in the repo directory run `scopes ./vim-scopes.sc > syntax/scopes.vim`.

If there's some mismatch between what is highlighted and legal code, feel free to file an issue. However, be aware that Midline string blocks will *not* be added, as they're more trouble to match than they're worth.
